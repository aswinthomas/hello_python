## Simple Python OOP Concepts

### Principles
- Encapsulation: Restricting direct access to some attributes
- Abstraction: Hide unnecessary implementation details e.g. provide a turnkey method
- Inheritance: Mechanism to reuse code across classes
- Polymorphism: Single entity to represent different types in different scenarios e.g. len(different types)

### Examples
- Introduction to class and constructors in constructor.py
- Class and static methods in methods.py
- Inheritance in inheritance.py
- Encapsulation in getter_setter.py
- Abstraction in abstraction.py
