## Simple Python OOP Concepts

### Classes
Classes are templates to create objects to avoid recreating them each time

- Attributes represent properties, state of an entity (e.g. age of a person)
- Methods represent behaviors of an entity (e.g. canceling an event)

### Principles

- Encapsulation: Restricting direct access to some attributes
- Abstraction: Hide unnecessary implementation details e.g. provide a turnkey method
- Inheritance: Mechanism to reuse code across classes
- Polymorphism: Relies on inheritance and allows classes to be instantiated as their parents. This enables a parent
  class to be manifested into any of its child class. A single entity is made to represent different types in different
  scenarios e.g. len(different types) during runtime

### Examples

- Introduction to class and constructors in constructor.py
- Class and static methods in methods.py
- Inheritance in inheritance.py
- Encapsulation in getter_setter.py
- Abstraction in abstraction.py
